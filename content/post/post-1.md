## Why?
As far as I know, the job scenario in India is moving towards skill/knowledge-based more and more, day by day. I believe one can expect a job in a technical role with good pay given she or he has a decent knowledge base, and a willingness to learn.

So, given you are technically apt with decent grasp/interest in what you are doing, you can indeed do learn a full tech-stack entirely on your own. Then, why should a person in their right mind give money to somebody else to do something doable alone?

From what I've learned, learning solo takes the difficulty of what you're doing to the next level. It requires much effort to "get" things, but it does work for some people. 

## What? 
I've always appreciated the fundamental idea coding boot camps are based upon, the one which allows you to pay once you land a job with so and so package.

Basically what these Income Share Agreement (ISA) based institutions are doing -- aligning the learner needs with their own. Such that both of them are incentivized to do their best.

All this feels too good to be true, to break into tech, I have re-joined one such coding boot camp/learning platform called [AttainU](attainu.com). 

## ðŸš€ How?

The approach of guided learning by experts, who are already working in tech is the way to go, which is what AttainU is doing. They focus on teaching what matters, this would be a nightmare to figure out on your own.

I have been on both ends, it is hands down more disheartening to try to learn something on your own and fail. Even while working harder than you need to, the same thing can be done more easily a little "hard to find" external help. 

This makes all the difference, given it's all about doing more.
