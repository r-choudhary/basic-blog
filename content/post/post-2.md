This is perhaps the biggest "bug" in my thinking pattern.

Whenever I am supposed to do a task, if I am unable to do it as smoothly as an X person with a couple of years of real life experience, I switch tasks in a jiffy. 

I probably can’t comprehend being average at something. 


## ✔ Case in Point 1 (Coding Problems):

I used to practice coding on hackerrank.com, but, once I got stuck in an easy problem? 

My solution was to switch to codewars.com, did all 8 kyu (easiest problems), loved it, started difficult problems, got stuck? 

Switched to hackerearth.com, found it too hard, switched to leetcode.com, then interviewcake.com, this goes on and on and on.

## ✔ Case in Point 2 (Mobiles/Laptops):

I see person X with XYZ mobile, they look happy and successful, maybe it's their mobile which will bring me happiness. 

Saw X with Mi mobile, bought it, didn’t feel fulfilled, then saw person Y with OnePlus, was biased toward chinese nature of the product. 

So, I bought an iPhone, which in my opinion is a step ahead of OnePlus, also matches with my mental image of “successful” people, but alas I am still unhappy, 

So, switched back to cheap Samsung, but frustrated with mobiles in general for now. Pretty much same story with Laptops.

## ✔ Case in Point 3 (Learning):

This book I am reading is alright, but I am tired, so I switch to another author. 

Next day, I feel bad about the original book I was reading, continue with book 2, stuck? 

Switch to another book, then I remember the original book I was reading, switch back to it, realize it is alright, make some progress, then move with the same cycle.

## Outcome: 
- I have read chapter 1 of at least a hundred books. 
- I have started a lot of stuff, but haven’t completed even a few of them.
- This slows me down, working on fixing this...
- Note that, I am actively looking for happiness in stuff that is materialistic.
- This is next level of overthinking, is it not?
